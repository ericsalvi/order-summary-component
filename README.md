## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- axe DevTools for accessibility
- [https://autoprefixer.github.io/](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

### What I learned

That Tailwind.css is very difficult to setup for these challenges. My initial attempt was to use only Tailwind but quickly nixed that after a few days of trial and error. 

### Continued development

I would like to use more SCSS and one day get into Tailwind fully. At this time I will keep on using SCSS to build out these components and I will also plan on using github terminal commands for building out the repositories and to maintain the content as it is being built out.
